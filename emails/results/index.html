RoleCraftID
Hello,
Thank you for completing the RoleCraft ID personality test. Based on your responses, your RoleCraft Identity (RCID) is:

{{primaryRole}} / {{secondaryCraft}}

This reflects how you are intrinsically motivated to contribute and how that contribution tends to show up in action. Below is a brief overview of each part of your profile, with links if you’d like to explore further.

Your Primary Role: {{primaryRole}}
Your Primary Role represents your core intrinsic contribution pattern.

People who express the {{primaryRole}} strongly are often recognized for the way they consistently influence outcomes, especially under pressure or ambiguity.

{{#if primaryRoleBullets}}
{{#each primaryRoleBullets}}

Your Secondary Craft: {{secondaryCraft}}

Your Self-Determination Priorities (SDP)
Your motivation is sustained by a specific mix of psychological drivers. Based on your assessment, your priorities rank as follows:

{{#each sdtPriorities}}
{{name}}
{{/each}}
These priorities don’t describe what you value abstractly—they describe what keeps you intrinsically motivated over time.

What to Do Next
Your RoleCraftID is not a label or limitation. It’s a tool for awareness and choice—one that becomes more useful as you apply it to real decisions, roles, and challenges.

On the RoleCraft site, you’ll find deeper explanations of Roles and Crafts, examples from real and fictional profiles, and campaigns and scenarios where your RCID can be applied.
